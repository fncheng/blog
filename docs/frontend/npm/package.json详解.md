"type"

> The `"type"` field defines the module format that Node.js uses for all `.js` files that have that `package.json` file as their nearest parent.
>
> When set to "module", the type field allows a package to specify all .js files within are ES modules. If the "type" field is omitted or set to "commonjs", all .js files are treated as CommonJS.
